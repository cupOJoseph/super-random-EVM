# superRandom
EVM library for easily accessing varying levels of randomness.

Only supports Rinkeby for now.

## Decent
DecentRandom.sol is a standalone pseudo random generating tool. It's randomness is decent, but could be slightly influenced by the miner of the block when random numbers are generated.  The Decent random getter should not be used if any significant amount of value is on the line, but it will be good for many simple uses.

### Use
Using the Decent random functions is easy. There are 2 main ways.

You can test these on Rinkeby here: TODO oneclickdapp link
